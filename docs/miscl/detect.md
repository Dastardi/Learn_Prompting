# ðŸŸ¢ Detecting AI Generated Text

Detecting AI generated text is a big problem for safety researchers and educators,
among others. Tools like [GPTZero](https://gptzero.me), [GPT2 detector](https://openai-openai-detector.hf.space), and [bilingual detectors](https://github.com/Hello-SimpleAI/chatgpt-comparison-detection) have seen siginificant success,
However, they can [be tricked](https://twitter.com/goodside/status/1610552172038737920?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw). Additionally, by running an open source model and modifying its
output probabilities, text will likely be much harder to detect.

OpenAI and other researchers(@bansal2022certified)(@gu2022watermarking) are working to introduce statistical watermarking into their
generated text, but this too may be fooled by modifying large portions of the text.

The problem of AI text detection will likely be an arms race as new models and 
new detection methods are introduced. Many companies have already started to 
build solutions which they claim are very effective, but it is difficult to prove
this, especially over time.

## Discussion

Many educators are very interested in this detection technology to prevent cheating, but some 
Internet commenters and other educators(@roose2022dont)(@lipman2022gpt) have expressed that they believe students should be allowed to use these tools. Some professors are explicitly encouraging students to use these tools to help them with their work, and teaching them how to do so(@noonan2023gw).

## Reality

Students will use the tools regardless of whether they are allowed to or not! We are not sure of the best policy to deal with this.
